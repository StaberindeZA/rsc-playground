# React Server Component Playground

## Introduction

This repo has 2 apps, a `Next.js` frontend with App Router and Server Actions, and `Nest.js` with GraphQL.

The idea behind this repo is to play around with some of the new concepts of RSC and Server Actions.

## Get you started

Pretty standard flow. This repo makes use of Nx, so it might be helpful to have [it installed globally](https://nx.dev/getting-started/installation#installing-nx-globally).

```
# Install the deps
npm install

# Startup Next and Nest...using Nx 
nx run-many -t serve
```
